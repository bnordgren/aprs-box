# Welcome to APRS Box

This site is a set of documents that will help you build a fairly complete and autonomous APRS base station, with the following capabilities:

- APRS Reception
- Autonomous mapping of APRS stations through a web browser
- Repeating and gating to Internet (iGating)
- Simple monitoring

This documentation can be used in several different ways: as a user reference, as a detailed guide to create and customize your own station, or as quick start guide to configure a BeagleBone/Rapsberry Pi in a couple of minutes and get going.

## APRS For all

Below is the talk I gave at [Paara](http://www.paara.org/) on November 6th 2015:

## This is a work in progress!

This micro site is by no means supposed to be a complete turnkey recipe to build you own APRS box. There are still many parts missing, but with your feedback, I will be able to improve it and turn it into something that will enable as many people as possible to have run with APRS!
